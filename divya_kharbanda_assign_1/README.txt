"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution to nyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional offense.
- I have made 10 Test cases to test my code.
- All the inputs required for the test cases are with in the code itself.
- The results that whether the test case is passed or not and the Title of Test case will be printed on Output file.
- Apart from this, I have added the SUM of all the values in Array list
